- AI
    - fancy sounding
- ML 
    - part of AI that produces actual results
- Data Science
    - Appliying ML to real-world problems

- Falsifiability
    - Something that can be proved wrong, linked with trustworthyness
    - Goes out of the window when things are intagiable

- All of our questions have to be falsifiable
- If we cant answer things with scientific tools, then it is not scientific

# Paradigms
Hypothesis-driven data science
    - start with a problem, collect/find data for research
Problem-driven data science
    - See above
Data-driven data science
    - Data set and want to find new insights
    - Are we basing our insights on a framed problem or what we want?

- Data science process 
    - Frame the problem
    - Collect raw data
    - Process data
    - Explore data
    - Perform in-depth analysis
    - Communicate results

- Proving
    - belongs to mathematics :^)
    - Outside of math EVIDENCE of things is used
    - Answering something with a HIGH PROBABILITY 

- Evidence is not conclusive
- Unclean data is like null values, extreme outliers, does it make sense in this domain?
    - we can try to clean it using assumptions by approximating based on the surrounding data.

Correlation
    - behavior/number changes affect each other
    - strong correlation - how certain are we that the effect takes place?

- Be true to the evidence, follow the evidence
